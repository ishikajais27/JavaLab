1. Aim of the program : A Plastic manufacturer sells plastic in different shapes like 2D sheet and 3D
   box. The cost of sheet is Rs 40/ per square ft. and the cost of box is Rs 60/ per cubic ft. Implement
   it in Java to calculate the cost of plastic as per the dimensions given by the user where 3D inherits
   from 2D.
   Input: Enter dimensions
   Output: Display the cost of plastic
2. Aim of the program : Illustrate the execution of constructors in multi-level inheritance with three
   Java classes â€“ plate(length, width), box(length, width, height), wood box (length, width, height, thick)
   where box inherits from plate and woodbox inherits from box class. Each class has constructor where
   dimensions are taken from user.
   Input: Enter the dimensions
   Output: Display the dimensions accordingly

3. Aim of the program : Write a program in Java having three classes Apple, Banana and
   Cherry. Class Banana and Cherry are inherited from class Apple and each class have their
   own member function show() . Using Dynamic Method Dispatch concept display all the show()
   method of each class.
   Input: Mention show function of each class.
   Output: Display show function of each class accordingly.

4. Aim of the program :Write a class Account containing acc_no, balance as data members
   and two methods as input() for taking input from user and disp() method to display the details.
   Create a subclass Person which has name and aadhar_no as extra data members and
   override disp() function. Write the complete program to take and print details of three persons.

Input: Enter details of three persons.
Output: Display details of three persons.
