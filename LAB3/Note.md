List of Programs :

1. Aim of the program :Write a class file – box with three data members(length, width, height)
   and a method volume() . Also implement the application class Demo where an object of the
   box class is created with user entered dimensions and volume is printed.

Input: length,width and height.
Output: Volume

2. Aim of the program : Write a program in Java to create a class Rectangle having data members
   length and breadth and three methods called read, calculate and display to read the values of
   length and breadth, calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle and display the result
   respectively.
   Create a class named &#39;Rectangle&#39; with two data members &#39;length&#39; and &#39;breadth&#39; and two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively.Its constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle.Create a class named &#39;Rectangle&#39; with two data members &#39;length&#39; and &#39;breadth&#39; and two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively.Its constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize length and breadth of the rectangle.  Input: Mention length and breadth Output: Display Area of Rectangle and Perimeter of rectangle.
3. Aim of the program : Write a program in java to input and display the details of n number of
   students having roll, name and cgpa as data members. Also display the name of the
   student having lowest cgpa.

Input: Enter Roll No, Name and cgpa of ‘n’ number of students.
Output: Display the details of ‘n’ number of students. Also display the name of

student with lowest cgpa 4. Aim of the program : Write a program to overload subtract method with various parameters in a
class in Java. Write the driver class to use the different subtract methods using object.
Input: Mention various subtract method having different parameters.
Output: Subtract method will display the result accordingly

5. Aim of the program : Write a program which will overload the area () method and display the
   area of a circle, triangle and square as per user choice and user entered dimensions.

Input: Mention dimensions like radius, base, height, side
Output: Display area of circle
Display area of triangle
Display area of square

6. Aim of the program : Write a program in java using constructor overloading concept to calculate
   the area of a rectangle having data member as length and breadth. Use default constructor to
   initialize the value of the data member to zero and parameterized constructor to initialize the value
   of data member according to the user input.

Input: Mention the value of length and breadth
Output: Display the area of rectangle accordingly.
